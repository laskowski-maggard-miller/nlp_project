Cats strives to provide functional programming abstractions that are core, [binary compatible](#binary-compatibility-and-versioning), [modular](https://typelevel.org/cats/motivations.html#modularity), [approachable](https://typelevel.org/cats/motivations.html#approachability) and [efficient](https://typelevel.org/cats/motivations.html#efficiency). A broader goal of Cats is to provide a foundation for an [ecosystem of pure, typeful libraries](https://typelevel.org/cats/typelevelEcosystem.html) to support functional programming in Scala applications.\n\nFor more detail about Cats' motivations, go [here](https://typelevel.org/cats/motivations.html).\n\n### Why \"cats\"?\n\nThe name is a playful shortening of the word *category*, from \"[category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory)\".\n\nRegardless, you do not need to know anything about category theory to use Cats.\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Code Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to [all the people who contribute](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/graphs/contributors). We welcome contributions to Cats and would love for you to help build\nCats. See our [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more\ninformation about how you can get involved as a developer.

For **Scala 2.12** you should add the following to your `build.sbt`:\n\n```scala\nscalacOptions += \"-Ypartial-unification\"\n```\n\n(Partial unification is on by default since Scala 2.13, the compiler no longer accepts `-Ypartial-unification`)\n\nAnd then create the Cats dependency, by adding the following to your `build.sbt`:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.typelevel\" %% \"cats-core\" % \"2.7.0\"\n```\n\nThis will pull in the cats-core module. If you require some other\nfunctionality, you can pick-and-choose from amongst these modules\n(used in place of `\"cats-core\"`):\n\n * `cats-kernel`: Small set of basic type classes (*required*).\n * `cats-core`: Most core type classes and functionality (*required*).\n * `cats-laws`: Laws for testing type class instances.\n * `cats-free`: Free structures such as the free monad, and supporting type classes.\n * `cats-testkit`: lib for writing tests for type class instances using laws.\n * `algebra`: Type classes to represent algebraic structures.\n * `alleycats-core`: Cats instances and classes which are not lawful.\n\n There are several other Cats modules that are in separate repos so that they can\n maintain independent release cycles.\n\n * [`cats-effect`](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect): standard `IO` type together with `Sync`, `Async` and `Effect` type classes\n * [`cats-mtl`](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-mtl): transformer typeclasses for Cats' Monads, Applicatives and Functors.\n * [`mouse`](https://github.com/typelevel/mouse): a small companion to Cats that provides convenient syntax (aka extension methods)\n * [`kittens`](https://github.com/typelevel/kittens): automatic type class instance derivation for Cats and generic utility functions\n * [`cats-tagless`](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-tagless): Utilities for tagless final encoded algebras\n * [`cats-collections`](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-collections): Data structures which facilitate pure functional programming\n * [`cats-testkit-scalatest`](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-testkit-scalatest): Cats testkit integration with Scalatest\n\nPast release notes for Cats are available in [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/main/CHANGES.md).\n\n### Documentation\n\nLinks:\n\n1.

The Typelevel Ecosystem: [typelevel.org/cats/typelevelEcosystem.html](https://typelevel.org/cats/typelevelEcosystem.html)\n\n### Community\n\nDiscussion around Cats is currently happening on GitHub issues, PR pages,\nand Discord:\n\nThe [Typelevel Discord](https://discord.gg/XF3CXcMzqD) has \\#cats and \\#cats-dev\nchannels, as well as community channels such as \\#beginners.  Please join us!\n\nPeople are expected to follow the\n[Scala Code of Conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/) when\ndiscussing Cats on GitHub, Discord, or other venues.\n\nWe hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If\nyou find yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or\nthat fails to live up to our expectations, you should disengage and\ncontact one of the [project maintainers](#maintainers) in private. We\nhope to avoid letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings escalate\ninto larger problems.\n\nIf you are being harassed, please contact one of [us](#maintainers)\nimmediately so that we can support you.\n\n### Binary compatibility and versioning\n\nAfter `1.0.0` release, we [decided](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1233)\nto use *MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH* [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)\ngoing forward, which is different from the *EPOCH.MAJOR.MINOR* scheme common among\nJava and Scala libraries (including the Scala lang).\n\nCats strives to provide a solid and stable foundation for an ecosystem of\nFP libraries. Thus, we treat backward binary compatibility maintenance with a high priority.\nIn semantic versioning, backward breaking change is **ONLY** allowed between *MAJOR* versions.\nWe will maintain backward binary compatibility between *PATCH* AND *MINOR* versions.\nFor example, when we release Cats `1.1.0`, it will be backward binary compatible\nwith the previous `1.0.x` versions. I.E. the new JAR will be a drop-in replacement for\nthe old one. This is critical when your application has a diamond\ndependency on Cats - depending on two or more libraries that all depend on Cats.\nIf one library upgrades to the new `1.1.0` Cats before the other one does, your\napplication still runs thanks to this backward binary compatibility.\n\nAlso worth noting is that according to semantic versioning,\n*MINOR* version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented\nif new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.\nIt MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated.\n\nAny binary breaking changes will require a *MAJOR* version bump, which we will be very\ncautious about. We will also consider using `organization` and package name for major\nversioning in the future. But that decision is yet to be made.\n\n### Adopters\n\nHere's a (non-exhaustive) list of companies that use Cats in production. Don't see yours?

  "readme_contents": "# NyaaV2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nyaadevs/nyaa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nyaadevs/nyaa)\n\n## Setting up for development\nThis project uses Python 3.7. There are features used that do not exist in 3.6, so make sure to use Python 3.7.\nThis guide also assumes you 1) are using Linux and 2) are somewhat capable with the commandline.   \nIt's not impossible to run Nyaa on Windows, but this guide doesn't focus on that.\n\n### Code Quality:\n- Before we get any deeper, remember to follow PEP8 style guidelines and run `./dev.py lint` before committing to see a list of warnings/problems.\n    - You may also use `./dev.py fix && ./dev.py isort` to automatically fix some of the issues reported by the previous command.\n- Other than PEP8, try to keep your code clean and easy to understand, as well. It's only polite!\n\n### Running Tests\nThe `tests` folder contains tests for the the `nyaa` module and the webserver. To run the tests:\n- Make sure that you are in the python virtual environment.\n- Run `./dev.py test` while in the repository directory.\n\n### Setting up Pyenv\npyenv eases the use of different Python versions, and as not all Linux distros offer 3.7 packages, it's right up our alley.\n- Install dependencies https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems\n- Install `pyenv` https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/README.md#installation\n- Install `pyenv-virtualenv` https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv/blob/master/README.md\n- Install Python 3.7.2 with `pyenv` and create a virtualenv for the project:\n    - `pyenv install 3.7.2`\n    - `pyenv virtualenv 3.7.2 nyaa`\n    - `pyenv activate nyaa`\n- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n- Copy `config.example.py` into `config.py`\n    - Change `SITE_FLAVOR` in your `config.py` depending on which instance you want to host\n\n### Setting up MySQL/MariaDB database\nYou *may* use SQLite but the current support for it in this project is outdated and rather unsupported.\n- Enable `USE_MYSQL` flag in config.py\n- Install latest mariadb by following instructions here https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/\n    - Tested versions: `mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.0.30-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2`\n- Run the following commands logged in as your root db user (substitute for your own `config.py` values if desired):\n    - `CREATE USER 'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test123';`\n    - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'test'@'localhost';`\n    - `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`\n    - `CREATE DATABASE nyaav2 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;`\n\n### Finishing up\n- Run `python db_create.py` to create the database and import categories\n    - Follow the advice of `db_create.py` and run `./db_migrate.py stamp head` to mark the database version for Alembic\n- Start the dev server with `python run.py`\n- When you are finished developing, deactivate your virtualenv with `pyenv deactivate` or `source deactivate` (or just close your shell session)\n\nYou're now ready for simple testing and development!   \nContinue below to learn about database migrations and enabling the advanced search engine, Elasticsearch.\n\n\n## Database migrations\n- Database migrations are done with [flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/), a wrapper around [Alembic](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/).\n- If someone has made changes in the database schema and included a new migration script:\n    - If your database has never been marked by Alembic (you're on a database from before the migrations), run `./db_migrate.py stamp head` before pulling the new migration script(s).\n        - If you already have the new scripts, check the output of `./db_migrate.py history` instead and choose a hash that matches your current database state, then run `./db_migrate.py stamp <hash>`.\n    - Update your branch (eg. `git fetch && git rebase origin/master`)\n    - Run `./db_migrate.py upgrade head` to run the migration. Done!\n- If *you* have made a change in the database schema:\n    - Save your changes in `models.py` and ensure the database schema matches the previous version (ie. your new tables/columns are not added to the live database)\n    - Run `./db_migrate.py migrate -m \"Short description of changes\"` to automatically generate a migration script for the changes\n      - Check the script (`migrations/versions/...`) and make sure it works! Alembic may not able to notice all changes.\n    - Run `./db_migrate.py upgrade` to run the migration and verify the upgrade works.\n       - (Run `./db_migrate.py downgrade` to verify the downgrade works as well, then upgrade again)\n\n\n## Setting up and enabling Elasticsearch\n\n### Installing Elasticsearch\n- Install JDK with `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`\n- Install [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)\n    - [From packages...](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html)\n        - Enable the service:\n            - `sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service`\n            - `sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service`\n    - or [simply extracting the archives and running the files](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html), if you don't feel like permantently installing ES\n- Run `curl -XGET 'localhost:9200'` and make sure ES is running\n    - Optional: install [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) as a search debug frontend for ES\n\n### Enabling MySQL Binlogging\n- Edit your MariaDB/MySQL server configuration and add the following under `[mariadb]`:\n    ```\n    log-bin\n    server_id=1\n    log-basename=master1\n    binlog-format=row\n    ```\n- Restart MariaDB/MySQL (`sudo service mysql restart`)\n- Copy the example configuration (`es_sync_config.example.json`) as `es_sync_config.json` and adjust options in it to your liking (verify the connection options!)\n- Connect to mysql as root\n    - Verify that the result of `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';` is `ROW`\n    - Execute `GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';` to allow your configured user access to the binlog\n\n### Setting up ES\n- Run `./create_es.sh` to create the indices for the torrents: `nyaa` and `sukebei`\n    - The output should show `acknowledged: true` twice\n- Stop the Nyaa app if you haven't already\n- Run `python import_to_es.py` to import all the torrents (on nyaa and sukebei) into the ES indices.\n    - This may take some time to run if you have plenty of torrents in your database.\n\nEnable the `USE_ELASTIC_SEARCH` flag in `config.py` and (re)start the application.   \nElasticsearch should now be functional! The ES indices won't be updated \"live\" with the current setup, continue below for instructions on how to hook Elasticsearch up to MySQL binlog.   \n\nHowever, take note that binglog is not necessary for simple ES testing and development; you can simply run `import_to_es.py` from time to time to reindex all the torrents.\n\n\n### Setting up sync_es.py\n`sync_es.py` keeps the Elasticsearch indices updated by reading the binlog and pushing the changes to the ES indices.\n- Make sure `es_sync_config.json` is configured with the user you grated the `REPLICATION` permissions\n- Run `import_to_es.py` and copy the outputted JSON into the file specified by `save_loc` in your `es_sync_config.json`\n- Run `sync_es.py` as-is *or*, for actual deployment, set it up as a service and run it, preferably as the system/root\n    - Make sure `sync_es.py` runs within the venv with the right dependencies!\n\nYou're done! The script should now be feeding updates from the database to Elasticsearch.   \nTake note, however, that the specified ES index refresh interval is 30 seconds, which may feel like a long time on local development. Feel free to adjust it or [poke Elasticsearch yourself!](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-refresh.html)\n"

To do this,\nuse `bat`s `--color=always` option to force colorized output. You can also use `--line-range`\noption to restrict the load times for long files:\n\n```bash\nfzf --preview 'bat --color=always --style=numbers --line-range=:500 {}'\n```\n\nFor more information, see [`fzf`'s `README`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#preview-window).\n\n#### `find` or `fd`\n\nYou can use the `-exec` option of `find` to preview all search results with `bat`:\n\n```bash\nfind \u2026 -exec bat {} +\n```\n\nIf you happen to use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), you can use the `-X`/`--exec-batch` option to do the same:\n\n```bash\nfd \u2026 -X bat\n```\n\n#### `ripgrep`\n\nWith [`batgrep`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batgrep.md), `bat` can be used as the printer for [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) search results.\n\n```bash\nbatgrep needle src/\n```\n\n#### `tail -f`\n\n`bat` can be combined with `tail -f` to continuously monitor a given file with syntax highlighting.\n\n```bash\ntail -f /var/log/pacman.log | bat --paging=never -l log\n```\n\nNote that we have to switch off paging in order for this to work. We have also specified the syntax\nexplicitly (`-l log`), as it can not be auto-detected in this case.\n\n#### `git`\n\nYou can combine `bat` with `git show` to view an older version of a given file with proper syntax\nhighlighting:\n\n```bash\ngit show v0.6.0:src/main.rs | bat -l rs\n```\n\n#### `git diff`\n\nYou can combine `bat` with `git diff` to view lines around code changes with proper syntax\nhighlighting:\n```bash\nbatdiff() {\n    git diff --name-only --relative --diff-filter=d | xargs bat --diff\n}\n```\nIf you prefer to use this as a separate tool, check out `batdiff` in [`bat-extras`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras).\n\nIf you are looking for more support for git and diff operations, check out [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta).\n\n#### `xclip`\n\nThe line numbers and Git modification markers in the output of `bat` can make it hard to copy\nthe contents of a file. To prevent this, you can call `bat` with the `-p`/`--plain` option or\nsimply pipe the output into `xclip`:\n```bash\nbat main.cpp | xclip\n```\n`bat` will detect that the output is being redirected and print the plain file contents.\n\n#### `man`\n\n`bat` can be used as a colorizing pager for `man`, by setting the\n`MANPAGER` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport MANPAGER=\"sh -c 'col -bx | bat -l man -p'\"\nman 2 select\n```\n(replace `bat` with `batcat` if you are on Debian or Ubuntu)\n\nIt might also be necessary to set `MANROFFOPT=\"-c\"` if you experience\nformatting problems.\n\nIf you prefer to have this bundled in a new command, you can also use [`batman`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batman.md).\n\nNote that the [Manpage syntax](assets/syntaxes/02_Extra/Manpage.sublime-syntax) is developed in this repository and still needs some work.\n\nAlso, note that this will [not work](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1145) with Mandocs `man` implementation.\n\n#### `prettier` / `shfmt` / `rustfmt`\n\nThe [`prettybat`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/prettybat.md) script is a wrapper that will format code and print it with `bat`.\n\n#### Highlighting `--help` messages\n\nYou can use `bat` to colorize help text: `$ cp --help | bat -plhelp`\n\nYou can also use a wrapper around this:\n\n```bash\n# in your .bashrc/.zshrc/*rc\nalias bathelp='bat --plain --language=help'\nhelp() {\n    \"$@\" --help 2>&1 | bathelp\n}\n```\n\nThen you can do `$ help cp` or `$ help git commit`.\n\nPlease report any issues with the help syntax in [this repository](https://github.com/victor-gp/cmd-help-sublime-syntax).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/bat-cat.svg)](https://repology.org/project/bat-cat/versions)\n\n### On Ubuntu (using `apt`)\n*... and other Debian-based Linux distributions.*\n\n`bat` is available on [Ubuntu since 20.04 (\"Focal\")](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=bat&exact=1) and [Debian since August 2021 (Debian 11 - \"Bullseye\")](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/bat).\n\nIf your Ubuntu/Debian installation is new enough you can simply run:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install bat\n```\n\n**Important**: If you install `bat` this way, please note that the executable may be installed as `batcat` instead of `bat` (due to [a name\nclash with another package](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/982)). You can set up a `bat -> batcat` symlink or alias to prevent any issues that may come up because of this and to be consistent with other distributions:\n``` bash\nmkdir -p ~/.local/bin\nln -s /usr/bin/batcat ~/.local/bin/bat\n```\n\n### On Ubuntu (using most recent `.deb` packages)\n*... and other Debian-based Linux distributions.*\n\nIf the package has not yet been promoted to your Ubuntu/Debian installation, or you want\nthe most recent release of `bat`, download the latest `.deb` package from the\n[release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases) and install it via:\n\n```bash\nsudo dpkg -i bat_0.18.3_amd64.deb  # adapt version number and architecture\n```\n\n### On Alpine Linux\n\nYou can install [the `bat` package](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=bat)\nfrom the official sources, provided you have the appropriate repository enabled:\n\n```bash\napk add bat\n```\n\n### On Arch Linux\n\nYou can install [the `bat` package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/bat/)\nfrom the official sources:\n\n```bash\npacman -S bat\n```\n\n### On Fedora\n\nYou can install [the `bat` package](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=27506) from the official [Fedora Modular](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/using-modules/) repository.\n\n```bash\ndnf install bat\n```\n\n### On Funtoo Linux\n\nYou can install [the `bat` package](https://github.com/funtoo/dev-kit/tree/1.4-release/sys-apps/bat) from dev-kit.\n\n```bash\nemerge sys-apps/bat\n```\n\n### On Gentoo Linux\n\nYou can install [the `bat` package](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/bat)\nfrom the official sources:\n\n```bash\nemerge sys-apps/bat\n```\n\n### On Void Linux\n\nYou can install `bat` via xbps-install:\n```bash\nxbps-install -S bat\n```\n\n### On Termux\n\nYou can install `bat` via pkg:\n```bash\npkg install bat\n```\n\n### On FreeBSD\n\nYou can install a precompiled [`bat` package](https://www.freshports.org/textproc/bat) with pkg:\n\n```bash\npkg install bat\n```\n\nor build it on your own from the FreeBSD ports:\n\n```bash\ncd /usr/ports/textproc/bat\nmake install\n```\n\n### On OpenBSD\n\nYou can install `bat` package using [`pkg_add(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1):\n\n```bash\npkg_add bat\n```\n\n### Via nix\n\nYou can install `bat` using the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix):\n\n```bash\nnix-env -i bat\n```\n\n### On openSUSE\n\nYou can install `bat` with zypper:\n\n```bash\nzypper install bat\n```\n\n### Via snap package\n\nThere is currently no recommended snap package available.\nExisting packages may be available, but are not officially supported and may contain [issues](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1519).\n\n### On macOS (or Linux) via Homebrew\n\nYou can install `bat` with [Homebrew on MacOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/bat) or [Homebrew on Linux](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula-linux/bat):\n\n```bash\nbrew install bat\n```\n\n### On macOS via MacPorts\n\nOr install `bat` with [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/bat/summary):\n\n```bash\nport install bat\n```\n\n### On Windows\n\nThere are a few options to install `bat` on Windows. Once you have installed `bat`,\ntake a look at the [\"Using `bat` on Windows\"](#using-bat-on-windows) section.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\nYou will need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) package.\n\n#### With Chocolatey\n\nYou can install `bat` via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/Bat):\n```bash\nchoco install bat\n```\n\n#### With Scoop\n\nYou can install `bat` via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):\n```bash\nscoop install bat\n```\n\n#### From prebuilt binaries:\n\nYou can download prebuilt binaries from the [Release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases),\n\nYou will need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) package.\n\n### From binaries\n\nCheck out the [Release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases) for\nprebuilt versions of `bat` for many different architectures. Statically-linked\nbinaries are also available: look for archives with `musl` in the file name.\n\n### From source\n\nIf you want to build `bat` from source, you need Rust 1.51 or\nhigher. You can then use `cargo` to build everything:\n\n```bash\ncargo install --locked bat\n```\n\nNote that additional files like the man page or shell completion\nfiles can not be installed in this way. They will be generated by `cargo` and should be available in the cargo target folder (under `build`).\n\n## Customization\n\n### Highlighting theme\n\nUse `bat --list-themes` to get a list of all available themes for syntax\nhighlighting. To select the `TwoDark` theme, call `bat` with the\n`--theme=TwoDark` option or set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable to\n`TwoDark`. Use `export BAT_THEME=\"TwoDark\"` in your shell's startup file to\nmake the change permanent. Alternatively, use `bat`s\n[configuration file](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#configuration-file).\n\nIf you want to preview the different themes on a custom file, you can use\nthe following command (you need [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for this):\n```bash\nbat --list-themes | fzf --preview=\"bat --theme={} --color=always /path/to/file\"\n```\n\n`bat` looks good on a dark background by default. However, if your terminal uses a\nlight background, some themes like `GitHub` or `OneHalfLight` will work better for you.\nYou can also use a custom theme by following the\n['Adding new themes' section below](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#adding-new-themes).\n\n### 8-bit themes\n\n`bat` has three themes that always use [8-bit colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors),\neven when truecolor support is available:\n\n- `ansi` looks decent on any terminal. It uses 3-bit colors: black, red, green,\n  yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.\n- `base16` is designed for [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) terminal themes. It uses\n  4-bit colors (3-bit colors plus bright variants) in accordance with the\n  [base16 styling guidelines](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/styling.md).\n- `base16-256` is designed for [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell).\n  It replaces certain bright colors with 8-bit colors from 16 to 21. **Do not** use this simply\n  because you have a 256-color terminal but are not using base16-shell.\n\nAlthough these themes are more restricted, they have three advantages over truecolor themes. They:\n\n- Enjoy maximum compatibility. Some terminal utilities do not support more than 3-bit colors.\n- Adapt to terminal theme changes. Even for already printed output.\n- Visually harmonize better with other terminal software.\n\n### Output style\n\nYou can use the `--style` option to control the appearance of `bat`s output.\nYou can use `--style=numbers,changes`, for example, to show only Git changes\nand line numbers but no grid and no file header. Set the `BAT_STYLE` environment\nvariable to make these changes permanent or use `bat`s\n[configuration file](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#configuration-file).\n\n### Adding new syntaxes / language definitions\n\nShould you find that a particular syntax is not available within `bat`, you can follow these\ninstructions to easily add new syntaxes to your current `bat` installation.\n\n`bat` uses the excellent [`syntect`](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/)\nlibrary for syntax highlighting. `syntect` can read any\n[Sublime Text `.sublime-syntax` file](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html)\nand theme.\n\nA good resource for finding Sublime Syntax packages is [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Once you found a\nsyntax:\n\n1. Create a folder with syntax definition files:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p \"$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes\"\n   cd \"$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes\"\n\n   # Put new '.sublime-syntax' language definition files\n   # in this folder (or its subdirectories), for example:\n   git clone https://github.com/tellnobody1/sublime-purescript-syntax\n   ```\n\n2. Now use the following command to parse these files into a binary cache:\n\n   ```bash\n   bat cache --build\n   ```\n\n3. Finally, use `bat --list-languages` to check if the new languages are available.\n\n   If you ever want to go back to the default settings, call:\n\n   ```bash\n   bat cache --clear\n   ```\n\n4. If you think that a specific syntax should be included in `bat` by default, please\n   consider opening a \"syntax request\" ticket after reading the policies and\n   instructions [here](doc/assets.md): [Open Syntax Request](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/new?labels=syntax-request&template=syntax_request.md).\n\n### Adding new themes\n\nThis works very similar to how we add new syntax definitions.\n\nFirst, create a folder with the new syntax highlighting themes:\n```bash\nmkdir -p \"$(bat --config-dir)/themes\"\ncd \"$(bat --config-dir)/themes\"\n\n# Download a theme in '.tmTheme' format, for example:\ngit clone https://github.com/greggb/sublime-snazzy\n\n# Update the binary cache\nbat cache --build\n```\n\nFinally, use `bat --list-themes` to check if the new themes are available.\n\n### Adding or changing file type associations\n\nYou can add new (or change existing) file name patterns using the `--map-syntax`\ncommand line option. The option takes an argument of the form `pattern:syntax` where\n`pattern` is a glob pattern that is matched against the file name and\nthe absolute file path. The `syntax` part is the full name of a supported language\n(use `bat --list-languages` for an overview).\n\n**Note:** You probably want to use this option as [an entry in `bat`'s configuration file](#configuration-file)\nfor persistence instead of passing it on the command line as a one-off. Generally\nyou'd just use `-l` if you want to manually specify a language for a file.\n\nExample: To use \"INI\" syntax highlighting for all files with a `.conf` file extension, use\n```bash\n--map-syntax='*.conf:INI'\n```\n\nExample: To open all files called `.ignore` (exact match) with the \"Git Ignore\" syntax, use:\n```bash\n--map-syntax='.ignore:Git Ignore'\n```\n\nExample: To open all `.conf` files in subfolders of `/etc/apache2` with the \"Apache Conf\"\nsyntax, use (this mapping is already built in):\n```bash\n--map-syntax='/etc/apache2/**/*.conf:Apache Conf'\n```\n\n### Using a different pager\n\n`bat` uses the pager that is specified in the `PAGER` environment variable. If this variable is not\nset, `less` is used by default. If you want to use a different pager, you can either modify the\n`PAGER` variable or set the `BAT_PAGER` environment variable to override what is specified in\n`PAGER`.\n\n**Note**: If `PAGER` is `more` or `most`, `bat` will silently use `less` instead to ensure support for colors.\n\nIf you want to pass command-line arguments to the pager, you can also set them via the\n`PAGER`/`BAT_PAGER` variables:\n\n```bash\nexport BAT_PAGER=\"less -RF\"\n```\n\nInstead of using environment variables, you can also use `bat`s [configuration file](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#configuration-file) to configure the pager (`--pager` option).\n\n**Note**: By default, if the pager is set to `less` (and no command-line options are specified),\n`bat` will pass the following command line options to the pager: `-R`/`--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS`,\n`-F`/`--quit-if-one-screen` and `-X`/`--no-init`. The last option (`-X`) is only used for `less`\nversions older than 530.\n\nThe `-R` option is needed to interpret ANSI colors correctly. The second option (`-F`) instructs\nless to exit immediately if the output size is smaller than the vertical size of the terminal.\nThis is convenient for small files because you do not have to press `q` to quit the pager. The\nthird option (`-X`) is needed to fix a bug with the `--quit-if-one-screen` feature in old versions\nof `less`. Unfortunately, it also breaks mouse-wheel support in `less`.\n\nIf you want to enable mouse-wheel scrolling on older versions of `less`, you can pass just `-R` (as\nin the example above, this will disable the quit-if-one-screen feature). For less 530 or newer,\nit should work out of the box.\n\n### Indentation\n\n`bat` expands tabs to 4 spaces by itself, not relying on the pager. To change this, simply add the\n`--tabs` argument with the number of spaces you want to be displayed.\n\n**Note**: Defining tab stops for the pager (via the `--pager` argument by `bat`, or via the `LESS`\nenvironment variable for `less`) won't be taken into account because the pager will already get\nexpanded spaces instead of tabs. This behaviour is added to avoid indentation issues caused by the\nsidebar. Calling `bat` with `--tabs=0` will override it and let tabs be consumed by the pager.\n\n### Dark mode\n\nIf you make use of the dark mode feature in macOS, you might want to configure `bat` to use a different\ntheme based on the OS theme. The following snippet uses the `default` theme when in the _dark mode_\nand the `GitHub` theme when in the _light mode_.\n\n```bash\nalias cat=\"bat --theme=\\$(defaults read -globalDomain AppleInterfaceStyle &> /dev/null && echo default || echo GitHub)\"\n```\n\n\n## Configuration file\n\n`bat` can also be customized with a configuration file. The location of the file is dependent\non your operating system. To get the default path for your system, call\n```bash\nbat --config-file\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `BAT_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to point `bat` to a\nnon-default location of the configuration file:\n```bash\nexport BAT_CONFIG_PATH=\"/path/to/bat.conf\"\n```\n\nA default configuration file can be created with the `--generate-config-file` option.\n```bash\nbat --generate-config-file\n```\n\n### Format\n\nThe configuration file is a simple list of command line arguments. Use `bat --help` to see a full list of possible options and values. In addition, you can add comments by prepending a line with the `#` character.\n\nExample configuration file:\n```bash\n# Set the theme to \"TwoDark\"\n--theme=\"TwoDark\"\n\n# Show line numbers, Git modifications and file header (but no grid)\n--style=\"numbers,changes,header\"\n\n# Use italic text on the terminal (not supported on all terminals)\n--italic-text=always\n\n# Use C++ syntax for Arduino .ino files\n--map-syntax \"*.ino:C++\"\n```\n\n## Using `bat` on Windows\n\n`bat` mostly works out-of-the-box on Windows, but a few features may need extra configuration.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou will need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) package.\n\n### Paging\n\nWindows only includes a very limited pager in the form of `more`. You can download a Windows binary\nfor `less` [from its homepage](http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/download.html) or [through\nChocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/Less). To use it, place the binary in a directory in\nyour `PATH` or [define an environment variable](#using-a-different-pager). The [Chocolatey package](#on-windows) installs `less` automatically.\n\n### Colors\n\nWindows 10 natively supports colors in both `conhost.exe` (Command Prompt) and PowerShell since\n[v1511](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_version_history#Version_1511_(November_Update)), as\nwell as in newer versions of bash. On earlier versions of Windows, you can use\n[Cmder](http://cmder.net/), which includes [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/).\n\n**Note:** The Git and MSYS versions of `less` do not correctly interpret colors on Windows. If you\ndon\u2019t have any other pagers installed, you can disable paging entirely by passing `--paging=never`\nor by setting `BAT_PAGER` to an empty string.\n\n### Cygwin\n\n`bat` on Windows does not natively support Cygwin's unix-style paths (`/cygdrive/*`). When passed an absolute cygwin path as an argument, `bat` will encounter the following error: `The system cannot find the path specified. (os error 3)`\n\nThis can be solved by creating a wrapper or adding the following function to your `.bash_profile` file:\n\n```bash\nbat() {\n    local index\n    local args=(\"$@\")\n    for index in $(seq 0 ${#args[@]}) ; do\n        case \"${args[index]}\" in\n        -*) continue;;\n        *)  [ -e \"${args[index]}\" ] && args[index]=\"$(cygpath --windows \"${args[index]}\")\";;\n        esac\n    done\n    command bat \"${args[@]}\"\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Garbled output\n\nIf an input file contains color codes or other ANSI escape sequences or control characters, `bat` will have problems\nperforming syntax highlighting and text wrapping, and thus the output can become garbled.\nWhen displaying such files it is recommended to disable both syntax highlighting and wrapping by\npassing the `--color=never --wrap=never` options to `bat`.\n\n### Terminals & colors\n\n`bat` handles terminals *with* and *without* truecolor support. However, the colors in most syntax\nhighlighting themes are not optimized for 8-bit colors. It is therefore strongly recommended\nthat you use a terminal with 24-bit truecolor support (`terminator`, `konsole`, `iTerm2`, ...),\nor use one of the basic [8-bit themes](#8-bit-themes) designed for a restricted set of colors.\nSee [this article](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) for more details and a full list of\nterminals with truecolor support.\n\nMake sure that your truecolor terminal sets the `COLORTERM` variable to either `truecolor` or\n`24bit`. Otherwise, `bat` will not be able to determine whether or not 24-bit escape sequences\nare supported (and fall back to 8-bit colors).\n\n### Line numbers and grid are hardly visible\n\nPlease try a different theme (see `bat --list-themes` for a list). The `OneHalfDark` and\n`OneHalfLight` themes provide grid and line colors that are brighter.\n\n### File encodings\n\n`bat` natively supports UTF-8 as well as UTF-16. For every other file encoding, you may need to\nconvert to UTF-8 first because the encodings can typically not be auto-detected. You can `iconv`\nto do so.\nExample: if you have a PHP file in Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding, you can call:\n``` bash\niconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 my-file.php | bat\n```\nNote: you might have to use the `-l`/`--language` option if the syntax can not be auto-detected\nby `bat`.\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\n# Recursive clone to retrieve all submodules\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/sharkdp/bat\n\n# Build (debug version)\ncd bat\ncargo build --bins\n\n# Run unit tests and integration tests\ncargo test\n\n# Install (release version)\ncargo install --path . --locked\n\n# Build a bat binary with modified syntaxes and themes\nbash assets/create.sh\ncargo install --path . --locked --force\n```\n\nIf you want to build an application that uses `bat`s pretty-printing\nfeatures as a library, check out the [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/bat/).\nNote that you have to use either `regex-onig` or `regex-fancy` as a feature\nwhen you depend on `bat` as a library.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTake a look at the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [sharkdp](https://github.com/sharkdp)\n- [eth-p](https://github.com/eth-p)\n- [keith-hall](https://github.com/keith-hall)\n- [Enselic](https://github.com/Enselic)\n\n## Security vulnerabilities\n\nPlease contact [David Peter](https://david-peter.de/) via email if you want to report a vulnerability in `bat`.\n\n## Project goals and alternatives\n\n`bat` tries to achieve the following goals:\n\n- Provide beautiful, advanced syntax highlighting\n- Integrate with Git to show file modifications\n- Be a drop-in replacement for (POSIX) `cat`\n- Offer a user-friendly command-line interface\n\nThere are a lot of alternatives, if you are looking for similar programs.

It provides a concrete tool, known as \"the <code>IO</code> monad\", for capturing and controlling actions, often referred to as \"effects\", that your program wishes to perform within a resource-safe, typed context with seamless support for concurrency and coordination. These effects may be asynchronous (callback-driven) or synchronous (directly returning values); they may return within microseconds or run infinitely.</p>\n\n<p>Even more importantly, Cats Effect defines a set of typeclasses which define what it means to be a purely functional runtime system. These abstractions power a thriving ecosystem consisting of streaming frameworks, JDBC database layers, HTTP servers and clients, asynchronous clients for systems like Redis and MongoDB, and so much more! Additionally, you can leverage these abstractions within your own application to unlock powerful capabilities with little-or-no code changes, for example solving problems such as dependency injection, multiple error channels, shared state across modules, tracing, and more.</p>\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Wired: **3.3.14**\n- Tired: **2.5.5** (end of life)\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.typelevel\" %% \"cats-effect\" % \"3.3.14\"\n```\n\nThe above represents the core, stable dependency which brings in the entirety of Cats Effect. This is *most likely* what you want. All current Cats Effect releases are published for Scala 2.12, 2.13, 3.0, and Scala.js 1.7.\n\nOr, if you prefer a less bare-bones starting point, you can try [the Giter8 template](https://github.com/typelevel/ce3.g8):\n\n```bash\n$ sbt -Dsbt.version=1.5.5 new typelevel/ce3.g8\n```\n\nDepending on your use-case, you may want to consider one of the several other modules which are made available within the Cats Effect release. If you're a datatype implementer (like [Monix](https://monix.io)), you probably only want to depend on **kernel** (the typeclasses) in your compile scope and **laws** in your test scope:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\n  \"org.typelevel\" %% \"cats-effect-kernel\" % \"3.3.14\",\n  \"org.typelevel\" %% \"cats-effect-laws\"   % \"3.3.14\" % Test)\n```\n\nIf you're a middleware framework (like [Fs2](https://fs2.io/)), you probably want to depend on **std**, which gives you access to `Queue`, `Semaphore`, and much more without introducing a hard-dependency on `IO` outside of your tests:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\n  \"org.typelevel\" %% \"cats-effect-std\" % \"3.3.14\",\n  \"org.typelevel\" %% \"cats-effect\"     % \"3.3.14\" % Test)\n```\n\nYou may also find some utility in the **testkit** and **kernel-testkit** projects, which contain `TestContext`, generators for `IO`, and a few other things:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.typelevel\" %% \"cats-effect-testkit\" % \"3.3.14\" % Test\n```\n\nCats Effect provides backward binary compatibility within the 2.x and 3.x version lines, and both forward and backward compatibility within any major/minor line. This is analogous to the versioning scheme used by Cats itself, as well as other major projects such as Scala.js. Thus, any project depending upon Cats Effect 2.2.1 can be used with libraries compiled against Cats Effect 2.0.0 or 2.2.3, but *not* with libraries compiled against 2.3.0 or higher.\n\n### Updating from Cats Effect 1.x / 2.x\n\nCheck out the [migration guide](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/migration-guide)!\n\n## Hello, World\n\n```scala\nimport cats.effect._\n\nobject Main extends IOApp.Simple {\n  val run = IO.println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}\n```\n\nOr, if you need the ability to take arguments and return exit codes:\n\n```scala\nimport cats.effect._\n\nobject Main extends IOApp {\n  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] =\n    if (args.headOption.map(_ == \"--do-it\").getOrElse(false))\n      IO.println(\"I did it!\").as(ExitCode.Success)\n    else\n      IO.println(\"Didn't do it\").as(ExitCode(-1))\n}\n```\n\n## Five Simple Rules\n\nAny program written using Cats Effect provides incredibly strong guarantees and powerful functionality, performance, safety, and composability, provided you follow each of the following rules:\n\n- **Wrap *all* side-effects** in `delay`, `async`, `blocking`, or `interruptible`/`interruptibleMany`\n  + (pro tip: try to keep the size of your `delay` blocks small; two `delay`s with a `flatMap` is much better than one big `delay`)\n- **Use `bracket` or `Resource`** for anything which must be `close`d\n- ***Never* hard-block a thread** outside of `blocking` or `interruptible`/`interruptibleMany`\n- **Use `IOApp`** instead of writing your own `def main`\n- Never call anything that has **the word `unsafe` in the name**\n\nIf you follow these rules, and you use libraries and frameworks which also follow these rules, you will get a truly astonishing array of things essentially for free:\n\n- Extremely high performance, elastic, and scalable applications\n- Proven backpressure mechanisms under extreme load in real deployments\n- Reliable resource safety in all cases\n- Aggressive interruption of unnecessary work (e.g. timeouts), automatically, without any extra implementation effort\n- Composable and modular application architecture (real, *practical* functional programming)\n- Simple, safe, and incredibly powerful concurrency mechanisms that get *faster* under high contention\n- Highly tuned application runtime with optimized threading and memory management semantics\n- Powerful and orthogonal abstractions which enable architectural decomposition that scales to any problem space\n- Access to an entire ecosystem of uniquely powerful libraries and tooling\n- \u2026and so much more\n\n## Performance\n\n<img width=\"461px\" height=\"356px\" align=\"right\" alt=\"a bar chart showing 'Fixed Thread Pool' and 'Cats Effect 3', with the latter being substantially taller than the former\" src=\"images/contention.png\"/>\n\n<p>Most functional and async frameworks will tout their performance on synthetic microbenchmarks, measuring things like how many <code>flatMap</code>s they can evaluate per microsecond and so on. However, most programs aren't just a bunch of <code>flatMap</code>s, and the true performance bottlenecks are usually in things like contention scaling under high load, memory and other resource management, backpressure, page faults, and such. In these areas, Cats Effect is truly unrivaled on the JVM, and in most cases, applications written in a purely functional style using Cats Effect will <em>exceed</em> the performance and elasticity of the same applications written in an imperative style.</p>\n\n<p>The chart to the right shows the results of a synthetic benchmark simulating an extremely high-contention scheduling scenario. The scenario is typical of something like a microservice handling extremely high requests-per-second, with each request representing some sort of scatter/gather semantic in which many complex asynchronous actions must be taken in parallel to produce a timely response.</p>\n\n[The benchmark](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/blob/220d0106ca0ff6106746a41504b6ab07d8fc9199/benchmarks/src/main/scala/cats/effect/benchmarks/WorkStealingBenchmark.scala) measures the performance of a typical \"disruptor pattern\" application written using a fixed thread pool (from `java.util.concurrent.Executors`) compared to the same workflow implemented using Cats Effect (specifically version 3.0). The scores are not a typo: Cats Effect is *almost 55x faster* than the typical disruptor-style, hand-tuned implementation. Similarly dramatic results are consistently observed when comparing Cats Effect with other popular asynchronous and functional frameworks.\n\nAs always, benchmarks are one thing, and your application is its own special snowflake with its own performance profile. Always measure and test *your application* before assuming that someone else's performance results apply in your use-case. When in doubt, [come talk with us](https://discord.gg/QNnHKHq5Ts) and we'll give you an honest opinion!\n\n## Abstraction\n\n![the cats effect hierarchy of typeclasses as of version 3.0](images/hierarchy.svg)\n\nCats Effect isn't just designed to enable high performance applications with out-of-the-box safety and elasticity under load. It was intended first and foremost as a tool for implementing *composable* and *reasonable* software that is easy to write, easy to test, and easy to evolve as your team and requirements change over time. To achieve this goal, Cats Effect embraces and enables strong, typeful, purely-functional programming styles that are uniquely tailored for the Scala language.\n\nThe typical Cats Effect system is often built in terms of simple, orthogonal, primitive capabilities which come together to represent all the expressive power necessary to encode a modern asynchronous runtime. Much like how the rules of addition, multiplication, and integers come together to define much of what we understand about basic arithmetic, so too do the rules of `Functor`, `Monad`, and `Concurrent` come together to define the nature of a *program* which has all the capabilities you need.\n\nBy learning and leveraging these capabilities directly, it is possible to write functions and classes which clearly state their requirements and capabilities in a *statically typed* and discoverable fashion, improving documentation, readability, and separation of concerns.\n\nAnd, just as with arithmetic, even when you don't directly leverage the nature of abstract mathematics in your daily life, those laws are still present shaping the world around you and enabling powerful and surprising things like computers and trains and restaurant menus. The laws and abstractions of Cats Effect support a powerful and unique ecosystem of frameworks, giving you access to rich and advanced functionality unparalleled in any language or ecosystem, battle tested in production environments ranging from some of the largest companies in the world to some of the nimblest startups.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

It works similar to `cat` but displays content with syntax highlighting.\n\n## Supported Languages\n\n* JavaScript\n* Java\n* Ruby\n* Python\n* Go\n* C\n* JSON\n\n## Installation\n\n### OSX\n\n```\n$ brew install ccat\n```\n\n### Arch Linux\n\n```\n$ pacaur -S ccat\n$ pacaur -S ccat-git\n```\nThe ccat package will reflect the current release snapshot, while the ccat-git will be based on the current source available in the master branch of the git repo. You can use any AUR helper in place of pacaur [AUR Helpers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers)\n\n### Standalone\n\n`ccat` can be easily installed as an executable.\nDownload the latest [compiled binaries](https://github.com/owenthereal/ccat/releases) and put it in your executable path.\n\n### From source\n\nPrerequisites:\n- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)\n- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.4+\n\n```\n$ go get -u github.com/owenthereal/ccat\n```\n\n## Completion (ZSH Only)\n\n### Installation\nMove the `_ccat` file in `./completions/zsh` to your site-functions directory usually in `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions` or in `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions`. If completions don't work on the next ZSH startup, you can delete the file `.zcompdump` (which caches autocomplete commands) and it is usually in the home directory.\n### Uninstallation\nGo back to the directory you copied `_ccat` to and delete the file, then simply delete `.zcompdump` in order to stop errors when trying to use `ccat` autocomplete afterwards.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n$ ccat FILE1 FILE2 ...\n$ ccat FILE1 FILE2 ... --html # output in HTML\n$ ccat --bg=dark FILE1 FILE 2 ... # dark background\n$ ccat -G String=\"_darkblue_\" -G Plaintext=\"darkred\" FILE # set color codes\n$ ccat --palette # show palette\n$ ccat # read from standard input\n$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owenthereal/ccat/master/main.go | ccat\n```\n\nIt's recommended to alias `ccat` to `cat`:\n\n```\nalias cat=ccat\n```\n\nThe overhead of `ccat` comparing to `cat` is mimimum:\n\n```\n$ wc -l main.go\n123 main.go\n$ time cat main.go > /dev/null\ncat main.go > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.00s system 61% cpu 0.005 total\n$ time ccat main.go > /dev/null\nccat main.go > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.00s system 78% cpu 0.007 total\n```\n\nYou can always invoke `cat` after aliasing `ccat` by typing `\\cat`.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![demo](https://asciinema.org/a/21858.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/21858)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [ ] nicer default color scheme\n- [ ] ?\n\n## Alternatives\n\n`ccat` is designed to be distributed in one binary, run at native speed\nand follow the POSIX standards. There're alternatives out there.\nUse them at your own risk :):\n\n* [pygments](http://pygments.org/)\n* [source-highlight](https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/owenthereal/ccat/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph) who built [this](https://github.com/sourcegraph/syntaxhighlight) awesome syntax-highlighting package.\n\n## Support\n\n### Backers\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.

  "readme_contents": "# Cats Blender Plugin (0.19.0)\n\nA tool designed to shorten steps needed to import and optimize models into VRChat.\nCompatible models are: MMD, XNALara, Mixamo, Source Engine, Unreal Engine, DAZ/Poser, Blender Rigify, Sims 2, Motion Builder, 3DS Max and potentially more\n\nWith Cats it takes only a few minutes to upload your model into VRChat.\nAll the hours long processes of fixing your models are compressed into a few functions!\n\nSo if you enjoy how this plugin saves you countless hours of work consider supporting us through Patreon.\nThere are a lot of perks like having your name inside the plugin!\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/BFIald5.png)](https://www.patreon.com/catsblenderplugin)\n\n#### Download here: [Cats Blender Plugin](https://github.com/michaeldegroot/cats-blender-plugin/archive/master.zip)\n\n## Features\n - Optimizing model with one click!\n - Creating lip syncing\n - Creating eye tracking\n - Automatic decimation (while keeping shapekeys)\n - Creating custom models easily\n - Creating texture atlas\n - Creating root bones for Dynamic Bones\n - Optimizing materials\n - Translating shape keys, bones, materials and meshes\n - Merging bone groups to reduce overall bone count\n - Auto updater\n\n*More to come!*\n\n## Discord\nJoin our Discord to report errors, suggestions and make comments!\n\n**Discord: https://discord.gg/f8yZGnv**\n\n## Requirements\n - Blender **2.79** or **2.80** or above (run as administrator is recommended)\n   - mmd_tools is **not required**! Cats comes pre-installed with it!\n - If you have custom Python installed which Blender might use, you need to have Numpy installed\n\n## Installation\n - Download the plugin: **[Cats Blender Plugin](https://github.com/michaeldegroot/cats-blender-plugin/archive/master.zip)**\n   - **Important: Do NOT extract the downloaded zip! You will need the zip file during installation!**\n - Install the addon in blender like so:\n   - *This shows Blender 2.79. In Blender 2.80+ go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons. Also you don't need to save the user settings there.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eZV1zrs.gif)\n\n - Check your 3d view and there should be a new menu item called **CATS** ....w00t\n   - Since Blender 2.80 the CATS tab is on the right in the menu that opens when pressing 'N'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pJfVsho.png)\n\n - If you need help figuring out how to use the tool (very outdated):\n\n[![VRChat - Cat's Blender Plugin Overview](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0gu0kEj2xwA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gu0kEj2xwA)\n\nSkip the step where he installs \"mmd_tools\" in the video below, it's not needed anymore! (also very outdated)\n\n[![VRChat - Importing an MMD to VRChat Megatutorial!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7P0ljQ6hU0A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P0ljQ6hU0A)\n\n## Code contributors:\n - Hotox\n - Shotariya\n - Neitri\n - Kiraver\n - Jordo\n - Ruubick\n - feilen\n\n\n## Model\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dYYAfb4.png)\n\nThis tries to completely fix your model with one click.\n\n##### Import/Export Model\n- Imports a model of the selected type with the optimal settings\n- Exports a model as an .fbx with the optimal settings\n\n##### Fix Model\n- Fixes your model automatically by:\n  - Reparenting bones\n  - Removing unnecessary bones\n  - Renaming and translating objects and bones\n  - Mixing weight paints\n  - Rotating the hips\n  - Joining meshes\n  - Removing rigidbodies, joints and bone groups\n  - Removing bone constraints\n  - Deleting unused vertex groups\n  - Using the correct shading\n  - Making it compatible with Full Body Tracking\n  - Combining similar materials\n\n##### Start Pose Mode\n- Lets you test how bones will move.\n\n##### Pose to Shape Key\n- Saves your current pose as a new shape key.\n\n##### Apply as Rest Pose\n- Applies the current pose position as the new rest position. This saves the shape keys and repairs ones that were broken due to scaling\n\n\n## Model Options\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZPj2VUJ.png)\n\n##### Translation\n- Translate certain entities from any japanese to english.\nThis uses an internal dictionary and Google Translate.\n\n##### Separate by material / loose parts / shapes\n- Separates a mesh by materials or loose parts or by whether or not the mesh is effected by a shape key\n\n##### Join meshes\n- Joins all/selected meshes together\n\n##### Merge Weights\n- Deletes the selected bones and adds their weight to their respective parents\n\n##### Delete Zero Weight Bones\n- Cleans up the bones hierarchy, deleting all bones that don't directly affect any vertices\n\n##### Delete Constraints\n- Removes constrains between bones causing specific bone movement as these are not used by VRChat\n\n##### Recalculate Normals\n- Makes normals point inside of the selected mesh\n- Don't use this on good looking meshes as this can screw them up\n\n##### Flip Normals\n- Flips the direction of the faces' normals of the selected mesh.\n\n##### Apply Transformations\n- Applies the position, rotation and scale to the armature and its meshes.\n\n##### Remove Doubles\n- Merges duplicated faces and vertices of the selected meshes.\n\n\n## Custom Model Creation\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/szIWglS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/04O63q1.png)\n\n**This makes creating custom avatars a breeze!**\n\n##### Merge Armatures\n- Merges the selected armature into the selected base armature.\n- **How to use:**\n  - Use \"Fix Model\" on both armatures\n    - Select the armature you want to fix in the list above the Fix Model button\n    - Ignore the \"Bones are missing\" warning if one of the armatures is incomplete (e.g hair only)\n    - If you don't want to use \"Fix Model\" make sure that the armature follows the CATS bone structure (https://i.imgur.com/F5KEt0M.png)\n    - DO NOT delete any main bones by yourself! CATS will merge them and delete all unused bones afterwards\n  - Now you have two options:\n    - Only move the mesh:\n      - Uncheck the checkbox \"Apply Transforms\"\n      - Move the mesh (and only the mesh!) of the merge armature to the desired position\n        - You can use Move, Scale and Rotate\n        - CATS will position the bones according to the mesh automatically\n    - OR move the armature (and with it the mesh):\n      - Check the checkbox \"Apply Transforms\"\n      - Move the armature to the desired position\n        - You can use Move, Scale and Rotate\n        - Make sure that both meshes and armatures are at their correct positions as they will stay exactly like this\n    - If you want to merge multiple objects from the same model it is often better to duplicate the armature for each of them and merge them individually\n  - Select the base armature and the armature you want to merge into the base armature in the panel\n  - If CATS can't detect the bone structure automatically: select a bone you want to attach the new armature to\n    - E.g.: For a hair armature select \"Head\" as the bone\n  - Press the \"Merge Armatures\" button -> Done!\n\n##### Attach Mesh to Armature\n- Attaches the selected mesh to the selected armature.\n- **How to use:**\n  - Move the mesh to the desired position\n    - You can use Move, Scale and Rotate\n    - INFO: The mesh will only be assigned to the selected bone\n    - E.g.: A jacket won't work, because it requires multiple bones.\n    - E.g.: A ring on a finger works perfectly, because the ring only needs one bone to move with (the finger bone)\n  - Select the base armature and the mesh you want to attach to the base armature in the panel\n  - Select the bone you want to attach the mesh to in the panel\n  - Press the \"Attach Mesh\" button -> Done!\n\n##### Support us:\n- We worked hard on this feature. If you like it consider supporting us, it helps a lot!\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/BFIald5.png)](https://www.patreon.com/catsblenderplugin)\n\n\n## Decimation\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5u3teLp.png)\n\n**Decimate your model automatically.**\n\n##### Smart Decimation\n- This will decimate all meshes while keeping every shapekey.\n\n##### Save Decimation\n- This will only decimate meshes with no shape keys.\n\n##### Half Decimation\n- This will only decimate meshes with less than 4 shape keys as those are often not used.\n\n##### Full Decimation\n- This will decimate your whole model deleting all shape keys in the process.\n\n##### Custom Decimation\n- This lets you choose the meshes and shape keys that should not be decimated.\n\n\n## Eye Tracking\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yw8INDO.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VHw73zM.png)\n\n**Eye tracking is used to artificially track someone when they come close to you.**\nIt's a good idea to check the eye movement in the testing tab after this operation to check the validity of the automatic eye tracking creation.\n\n##### Disable Eye Blinking\n- Disables eye blinking. Useful if you only want eye movement.\n\n##### Disable Eye Movement\n- Disables eye movement. Useful if you only want blinking. **IMPORTANT:** Do your decimation first if you check this!\n\n##### Eye Movement Speed\n- Configure eye movement speed\n\n\n## Visemes (Lip Sync)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/muM2PTS.png)\n\n**Mouth visemes are used to show more realistic mouth movement in-game when talking over the microphone.**\nThe script generates 15 shape keys from the 3 shape keys you specified. It uses the mouth visemes A, OH and CH to generate this output.\n\n\n## Bone parenting\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mgadT4R.png)\n\n**Useful for Dynamic Bones where it is ideal to have one root bone full of child bones.**\nThis works by checking all bones and trying to figure out if they can be grouped together, which will appear in a list for you to choose from. After satisfied with the selection of this group you can then press 'Parent bones' and the child bones will be parented to a new bone named RootBone_xyz\n\n##### To parent\n- List of bones that look like they could be parented together to a root bone. Select a group of bones from the list and press \"Parent bones\"\n\n##### Refresh list\n- Clears the group bones list cache and rebuild it, useful if bones have changed or your model\n\n##### Parent bones\n- Starts the parent process\n\n\n## Texture atlas\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XcoF0Ek.png)\n\n**Texture atlas is the process of combining multiple textures into one to drastically reduce draw calls and therefore make your model much more performant**\n\n##### Create Atlas\n- Combines all selected materials into one texture. If no material list is generated it will combine all materials.\n\n##### Generate Material List\n- Lists all materials of the current model and lets you select which ones you want to combine.\n\n### Useful Tips:\n- Split transparent and non-transparent textures into separate atlases to avoid transparency issues\n- Make sure that the created textures are not too big, because Unity will downscale them to 2048x2048. \n  Split them across multiple atlases or reduce the individual texture sizes. This can be easily done in the MatCombiner tab.\n- You can tell Unity to use up to 8k textures.\n  Do so by selecting the texture and then choose a different Max Size and/or Compression in the inspector:\n  https://i.imgur.com/o01T4Gb.png\n\n\n## Bone merging\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FXwOvho.png)\n\n**Lets you reduce overall bone count in a group set of bones.**\nThis works by checking all bones and trying to figure out if they can be grouped together, which will appear in a list for you to choose from. After satisfied with the selection of this group you can then set a percentage value how much bones you would like to merge together in itself and press 'Merge bones'\n\n##### Refresh list\n- Clears the group bones list cache and rebuild it, useful if bones have changed or your model\n\n##### Merge bones\n- Starts the merge process\n\n\n## Bake\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1109288/97830517-147d1500-1c82-11eb-8b20-feba732ad672.png)<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/790488253764730920/791146826774216744/unknown.png\" height=\"735\" />\n\n**This is a non-destructive way to instantly produce a optimized/Quest variant of (almost) any avatar!**\n\nFor more information please visit the **[Bake Panel Wiki Page](https://github.com/GiveMeAllYourCats/cats-blender-plugin/wiki/Bake)**.\n\n\n## Shape Key\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LgFK4KO.png)\n\n**Apply Shape Key as Basis**\n- Applies the selected shape key as the new Basis and creates a reverted shape key from the selected one.\n\n\n## Settings and Updates\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hYy7gD8.png)\n\n**This plugin has an auto updater.**\nIt checks for a new version automatically once every day.\n\n---\n\n## Changelog\n\n#### 0.19.0\n- **Fully compatible with Blender 2.93**\n- **Translations:**\n  - **Added Korean translation!**\n    - Cats is now translated into Korean by a large portion\n    - To use it, simply change your Blender language to Korean and then restart Blender or select it in the Cats Settings\n    - Thanks to **Siromori** for contributing the translation! <3\n  - Added Cats Ui Language setting\n    - This lets you choose in which language Cats should be displayed\n    - Setting it to \"auto\" will choose the current Blender language\n  - Added button to download the latest Cats Translations\n    - This feature is for translators to test their translations in the plugin\n    - If you want to help to translate Cats into any language, please let me (Hotox) know in our Discord\n- **Model Options:**\n  - Added \"Connect Bones\" button\n  - Added options to keep merged bones and to merge the bones of visible meshes only\n- **Custom Model Creation:**\n  - Reworked \"Attach Mesh\" feature, it is much more reliable now\n- **General:**\n  - Fixed translation errors\n  - Updated mmd_tools\n- **Bake: (by feilen)**\n  - Emission influence baking: fake realtime lighting based on your emissive channel, quest-compatible!\n  - 'Manual' reprojection mode for Bake: creating new UV maps called 'Target' will allow you to re-bake to a specific layout.\n  - 'Optimize static shapekeys' option\n    - Splits your mesh into two skinned meshes, one with all shapekey-influenced geometry, \n      one with the rest (and fixes the normals in place). Significantly improves GPU performance, especially when a lot of shapekeys are in effect. \n      Needs the lighting anchor point in Unity to be set to the armature Hips on both, or you'll get lighting artifacts.\n  - Introduce 'BakeFixer.cs', which is a run-time unity script that hopefully should do the lighting work for you.\n  - 'Ignore hidden objects' option\n    - When baking, this will ignore any objects you currently have hidden, making it easier to create different versions of your avatar.\n  - Apply Current Shapekey Mix option \n    - Sets your basis to whatever current mix of shapekeys you have. Always-on shapekeys are terrible for performance, \n      so if you have some that are only intended to customize the character without updates, this will help with that.\n  - '_bake' shapekeys: any shapekey with '_bake' at the end will be applied and completely removed, allowing the static shapekeys option to work better. \n    If you're an avatar creator distributing bases, this is recommended for character customization keys!\n  - Misc: Updated defaults to be in line with updated Quest limits.\n\n\n#### 0.18.0\n- **Added Bake Panel!**\n  - This is a non-destructive way to produce an optimized variant of (almost) any avatar!\n  - Full credit goes to **feilen**!
